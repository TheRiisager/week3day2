        <h1>Exercises for week 3</h1>
        <p>This project (week3day2) contains the bulk of this weeks exercises, linked below. <br>
            The exercises for day 3, done with node.js without a html page, can be found in a seperate folder on github (JSday3). <br>
            The first three HTML/JS exercises are done, but not the last two.<br>
            The very last, optional, exercise is completed under "JS frontend for movie", but is missing data due to issues with getting test data onto my droplet.
